  ],
  "text": [
    "If you\u2019ve been doomscrolling your way to online real estate listings, dreaming of buying a home with more space and finding a lot that you can\u2019t afford, you\u2019re not alone. Searching Zillow has become a pandemic coping strategy for many, though rapidly rising sale prices are likely contributing to our anxiety rather than alleviating it. Nationally, home prices in December ",
    "increased 10.4%",
    " over the previous year.",
    "It\u2019s easy to get caught up in Zillow\u2019s automated home value estimates\u2014Zestimates\u2014when starting your (real or hypothetical) home search. But Zestimates don\u2019t often reflect what a home is actually worth, nor what it\u2019ll sell for in the end. ",
    "In some markets, like highly competitive Phoenix, ",
    "real estate agents have found",
    " that the Zestimate model tends to overvalue properties. On the flip side, the Zestimate doesn\u2019t matter at all if sellers are listing homes at higher prices and buyers are offering much more than that. ",
    "The Zestimate is Zillow\u2019s home valuation tool. It uses available data from public records as well as information about a home\u2019s features to approximate the value. Zestimates, when available, are included in property listings. ",
    "Here\u2019s ",
    "what the Zestimate considers",
    ": ",
    "Zillow acknowledges that its Zestimates are ",
    "not",
    " official appraisals and fall within a margin of error. The more data that\u2019s available for an area and a specific property, the more accurate the Zestimate. ",
    "However, the ",
    "median error rate",
    " for homes on the market is 1.9%, meaning only half of all Zestimates are within 2% of the selling price. The median error rate for off-market homes is 7.5%. The error rate is higher in some markets and lower in others. ",
    "The bottom line, though, is that a Zestimate could be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars off\u2014and it\u2019s not the same as the sale price. What this means is that you shouldn\u2019t take Zillow\u2019s Zestimate as gospel, whether you\u2019re buying or selling, but instead it can be helpful to have a real estate agent who can give you a more specific analysis of your market and determine what\u2019s over- and underpriced."

So, like on your cable, a lot of people have cable modems and you can actually plug into your cable modem and see what your signal levels are. So whenever I have really bad Internet, I can go on there, look at my my my signal levels. And then when I call Charter to yell at them [since] I have more information. ",
    "On why it\u2019s important to invest in a good-quality router:",
    " I think the technology is changing so, so rapidly and improving exponentially that it just makes sense to kind of keep up to date with that stuff and invest wisely when you do get a new router.

    "[S]cience indicates that plants do not necessarily clean up the indoor air quality that much, but, you know, greenery, open spaces, being outside. I mean, these are things that have been shown have clinical like have actual mental health benefits. And so being outside, especially during the workday, not to say it\u2019s super easy, but if you bring a little bit the outside in, perhaps getting some plants...that is actually really good for your mental health.",

    "In this weekend\u2019s assignment for our ",
    "October health reset",
    ", we\u2019re going to look at the place",
    " where you ",
    "spend most of y",
    "our day: y",
    "our workspace",
    ". Health isn\u2019t just a thing that happens when you\u2019re away from your desk; you deserve to support your well-being even while you\u2019re working. ",
    "We\u2019re focusing on small tweaks to home workspaces in this installment, although your health is important no matter where or how you work. In many traditional ",
    "workplaces, organizing with fellow workers to ",
    "demand healthier working conditions",
    " is one of the things that should be on your mind. ",
    "As some states prepare to open up again, against the advice of experts, what protections do workers ",
    "But for now, let\u2019s take a look at your desk or study space at home. ",
    "First things first: A",
    "re you comfortable when you sit down to work? If you\u2019ve been making do with an uncomfortable chair, treat yourself to a better one or take steps to make the one you have fit you better. Adjusting your chair\u2019s seat depth, height and back support can make a big difference, as our own Abu Zafar found out when he ",
    "invited an ergonomics expert to review his workspace",
    ". ",
    "But if that\u2019s not your style, good news: you don\u2019t have to find the perfect chair and the perfect position. You can simply ",
    "move around during the day",
    " if that feels better to you. What matters is that you feel comfortable, not the exact way you find that comfort. I sit in a wooden chair with a pillowy footstool",
    " and shift position every few minutes. That\u2019s not in any of the ergonomics guides, but it works for me.",
    "Is your keyboard too high? Your screen too low? Do you struggle to work with the trackpad on your laptop for precision tasks? All of these things are fixable. It\u2019s totally fair game to get a separate mouse or keyboard if that will make you more comfortable or help you get your work done, and you can prop up a laptop or monitor on a stand\u2014or even a stack of books. ",
    "Also, remember that you can do different tasks in different areas, and optimize each accordingly. For example, a cheap folding table with a stack of books on top makes a great Z",
    "oom call setup\u2014just carry it to the spot ",
    "in the house that ",
    "has the nicest looking background.",
    "Not long ago we shared some ",
    "suggestions to get exercise while you work or during your breaks",
    ". Besides setting up a standing or moving desk, you can make the time and space to get a fit",
    " mini workouts in, and dress at the beginning of the day in a way that facilitates that (sweatpants + a Z",
    "oom-appropriate top are ",
    " a classic combination). ",
    "Do you prefer to get your workout in bit-by-bit during the workday instead of going to the gym? Or\u2026",
    "I don\u2019t mean that you need a supply of",
    "\u00a0",
    "meal-prepped lunches",
    " in the fridge (although that would be great). I\u2019m thinking about whether you\u2019ve given any intentional thought to when, where and how you\u2019ll eat during the workday? ",
    "If you always mean to ",
    "step away from your desk for lunch",
    "\u00a0",
    "but end up eating at your desk anyway, there\u2019s probably room for improvement. Either figure out how you can keep your promise to yourself, or rethink your expectations\u2014",
    "and be kind to yourself about it. ",
    "Eating lunch at your desk seems like a good idea. After all, you get more work done, show your\u2026",
    "For example, you might want to keep napkins and a coaster at your desk so that you can eat those meals neatly, and so your plate has a space of its own instead of getting plopped on top of the books and papers that are already there. Or maybe you eat at your desk because you get hungry in the middle of deadlines; in that case, keep some ",
    "healthy snacks",
    " on hand to tide you over until you can take a real break. ",
    "Finally, the one thing you\u2019ve been neglecting: just clean your desk already. If your desk is anything like mine there are things you have placed there intentionally, like a dying spider plant, and then there are things that have just accumulated.",
    "Earlier this year, ",
    "I spent a mere 10 minutes cleaning my desk with the emotional support of my coworkers",
    ". The payoff was incredible: a year\u2019s worth of detritus, gone in a flash",
    ". But m",
    "y desk is once again looking like the \u201cbefore\u201d picture, and I\u2019m thinking I might actually... ",
    "do it again? And maybe I will feel ",
    "calmer when I look at it",
    ", instead of stressed by the mess and by the papers I printed out and haven\u2019t done",
    " anything with?",
    "What\u2019s that one nagging item that keeps rolling over from week to week on your to-do list? Mending\u2026",
    "Your results may vary, but a clean desk is a nice thing to have. You could even spruce up your surroundings\u2014hang a new picture, water that spider plant. While you\u2019re at it, give yourself a routine to follow. Maybe remove dirty dishes and unneeded papers at the end of each day, and empty the trash each week. I know, big steps. But if you\u2019re happier and maybe a tiny bit healthier, it\u2019s worth it. "

    "Why the Rent vs. Buy Debate Is Completely Pointless"
  ],
  "text": [
    "After saving up for a long time, I recently bought a home, which caught some of my friends off guard. \u201cI thought you were anti-homeownership,\u201d they said, because I think renting is underrated. Even as a homeowner, I ",
    "still",
    " think renting is underrated. But that doesn\u2019t mean buying is a bad decision. The rent vs. buy debate is just silly overall, and ignores the enormous grey area that exists between the two options.",
    "For years, buying a home was a measure of financial success. The housing crisis flipped that idea on its head, though, and people realized buying isn\u2019t always smart. In fact, I\u2019ve recently come across quite a few articles (",
    "or headlines, at least",
    ") that actually proclaim ",
    "buying a home is a stupid decision.",
    " If you dig into the meat of those articles, they explain that, sure, buying a home ",
    "can",
    " be a good decision, but their headlines sum up the takeaway: buying a home is a dumb money move that sounds smart.",
    "We\u2019ve oversold the dream of homeownership for years, but now it seems like we\u2019re taking it to the other extreme. So how did we go from years of believing homeownership is a smart financial move, to now believing it\u2019s one of the worst financial moves you can make? To address the question, it helps to see ",
    "both sides of the argument",
    ".",
    "You\u2019re out of debt, and you\u2019ve start funneling your money toward your next big financial goal:\u2026",
    "Strong arguments in favor of buying are usually:",
    "And the equally solid arguments in favor of renting:",
    "All of these points are valid, and I considered them in my own decision, too. The thing is, though, there\u2019s a ",
    "huge",
    " amount of grey area\u2014individual factors\u2014 in all of them, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to assert that either decision is the best decision. These factors are important, but the debate that comes with them is useless because the answer hinges on specifics: rent prices, interest rates, and so on. Buying a home can indeed be a bad financial move, but for many people, it isn\u2019t.",
    "In other words, neither option is inherently smart or dumb, despite what traditional thinking and headlines will have you believe. It comes down to crunching some numbers, perhaps changing the way you think about homeownership, and protecting your finances.",
    "When you buy a home, you pay for things you don\u2019t have to pay for as a renter: loan interest, property taxes, insurance, and even maintenance and repair costs. That\u2019s part of the argument in favor of renting: there are so many additional costs and factors that get overlooked. That goes for both sides, though, and the details vary depending on the situation. Here are a few ",
    "commonly overlooked factors",
    " that make up the specifics.",
    "When popular myths get debunked, people often throw the baby out with the bathwater. Buying a home\u2026",
    "These are just a few factors, and they\u2019re still far from conclusive in either direction. There are lots of caveats to consider. For example, opportunity cost is great, but are you actually going to invest that money, or just hoard it in your low-interest checking account? If you don\u2019t earn a return, the point is moot.",
    "It\u2019s impossible to say renting or buying is a better decision for everyone because each one of these factors (and more) depends on your unique situation. You have to consider where you live, what kind of house you\u2019re looking for, how much you pay in rent, how much you\u2019ll pay in the future...the list goes on and on.",
    "The ",
    "New York Times Rent vs. Buy calculator",
    " is, hands down, the best we\u2019ve seen for simplifying these complexities, depending on your own individual specifics. Still, a calculator can only do so much. It might tell you the better long-term decision on paper, but that still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best decision for ",
    "you",
    ".",
    "The hidden costs of homebuying aren\u2019t secrets, per se\u2014they\u2019re expenses that are hard to predict if\u2026",
    "For example, when my fianc\u00e9 and I crunched the numbers a few years ago, the calculator told us that buying was better if our rent was over $1,500 per month. At that point, our rent was $1,600, so technically, buying would have made more sense on paper. However, our down payment would have been less than 10%, and aside from a small emergency fund, we didn\u2019t have much in savings. If one of us lost our job, we\u2019d have trouble paying the mortgage. All of that was enough to postpone buying, despite what the calculator said.",
    "The point is: As much as it does come down to the numbers, there\u2019s ",
    "still",
    " more that goes into the decision. You have to consider affordability.",
    "Most experts agree that you shouldn\u2019t think of your primary home as an investment. Contrary to popular belief, ",
    "real estate barely outpaces inflation",
    " over time. Sure, you could time the market, flip a house, or buy a rental, but that\u2019s different from expecting your primary home to earn you a sweet return. The investing myth is another valid argument against buying. Many people buy homes they can\u2019t afford or stretch their finances to pay for expensive home projects ",
    "because they buy into this myth",
    ".",
    "Experts agree that buying can be a bad investment, but the problem is, many misinterpret this to mean ",
    "buying a home is a bad idea in general",
    ". Just because your home isn\u2019t a great ",
    "investment",
    " doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a bad ",
    "purchase",
    ".",
    "With any purchase, there\u2019s the matter of individual affordability. Most people are familiar with the ",
    "20% rule for buying a home",
    ". Whether you put down that exact amount or not, you should avoid buying a house you can\u2019t afford to keep. How do you define \u201caffordable,\u201d though? This is where rules of thumb come in handy. It may seem contradictory to suggest ballpark rules when we\u2019ve been talking about taking your individual case into account, but they give you some smart guidelines to follow.",
    "Could you stand living with your parents for a bit longer if it meant saving up more for a down\u2026",
    "For example, the ",
    "25% rule",
    ", which says your housing costs shouldn\u2019t be more than 25% of your take-home pay, is good for that. It\u2019s not just your monthly payment, though; you also want to make sure you have enough cash in reserves in case of an emergency. In other words, don\u2019t be \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
    "Of course, there\u2019s the emotional aspect, or the American Dream, of homeownership. However, if the numbers don\u2019t add up, and you\u2019re going to be house poor, buying a home ",
    "for the sake of owning",
    " is pretty pointless. The sense of satisfaction you get from owning is kind of offset by the risk of losing it to the bank. If the numbers ",
    "do",
    " add up, however, and your monthly mortgage payment isn\u2019t going to financially ruin you, that\u2019s a different story.",
    "The bottom line is: sometimes it\u2019s smarter to rent, and sometimes buying can work in your favor. Rather than giving in to one side or another, it\u2019s more helpful to learn the rules, crunch the numbers, then do what works\u2014and feels right\u2014for you.",

    "In most cases wearing a mask and social distancing is all that\u2019s needed for home inspection, but the increase in virtual buying can be attributed to people who are highly motivated and ",

    "Of course, nothing beats the traditional in-person inspection to give you a good sense of space, light, noises,",
    " or smells of a place\u2014",
    "but in the case of virtual buying,",
    " your realtor can serve as your proxy. Plus, real estate companies have made strides in offering enhanced options for viewing a home from afar",

    " and virtual tours.",
    "\u201cWe have had a huge uptick in the amount of clients, many who have purchased straight from the video without seeing the property until they\u2019re in the inspection period, or we\u2019ve narrowed down the properties based on the video,\u201d says RE/MAX realtor Sue Benson in a ",
    "recent interview with Bankrate",
    " .",
    "Don\u2019t rely too much on photos or videos provided by the seller in making your decision to buy a house. Instead, use those tools to help you narrow down a short list of a few homes, after which you can arrange to have your agent provide a separate, private ",

    "Questions to Ask Your Realtor When Selling Your Home"
  ],
  "text": [
    "With home prices up ",
    "pretty much everywhere",
    ", you may have decided to sell your home. To get the most out of your property, you\u2019ll need to hire a good real estate agent who knows how to price a property, market it, and negotiate effectively. To find the right agent, you\u2019ll need to ask the right questions\u2014like the ones below. ",
    "You can find an agent by researching local agents online, or through the ",
    "Find a Realtor",
    " search tool, but most commonly home sellers find an agent through their own personal network (40% according to the ",
    "National Association of Realtors",
    "\u00a0",
    "). Of course, even a referral from someone you trust should be taken with a grain to salt. You\u2019ll want to schedule an interview with any prospective agent and ask them the following questions:",
    "Knowledge is confidence. Make sure your agent is licensed by your state and has met the minimum levels of education, training, and testing. Also,",
    " ask if they\u2019re a realtor, a designation which means they\u2019ve had additional training and follow a strict code of ethics as members of the ",
    "National Association of Realtors",
    " (roughly 50% of the agents are realtors). The organization also has ",
    "all sorts of impressive certifications",
    " that your realtor might have, including the highest certification,",
    " known as the Certified Residential Specialist (held by about 4% of Realtors nationwide). A \u201cbroker\u201d is another designation that comes with more education (it gives a realtor the power to oversee ordinary agents).",
    "Ideally, you\u2019ll want an agent with some experience. Look for at least three years of experience selling residential real estate, particularly homes like yours. As home selling is a legal process with many moving parts in a limited time frame, an experienced agent will have a better sense of the possible pitfalls (like changing market conditions or failed inspections) and how to deal with them calmly.",
    "The trade-off here is that you will likely pay for that experience through higher commission fees (6% is the ",
    "national average",
    "). You might be able to negotiate a lower commission rate with a less experienced agent, but that will carry some additional risk. But that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a rising star, either. You\u2019ll want to ask about their track record, which leads",
    " to our",
    " next question:",
    "Ask your prospective agent for the listing and sales dates of their most recent transactions; y",
    "ou\u2019re looking for completed sales within a couple of months, not homes that take months or years to sell (especially in a good market). A good agent should have a strong handle on what your home is worth. Ask about their ",
    "average list to sale price ratio",
    ": over 100% means that your agent is consistently selling homes above the list price, which is what you can expect from a top-",
    "selling agent. The list-",
    "to-",
    "price ratio has its limits, however\u2014market valuation is not an exact science,",
    " and even a good agents can post a list price that turns out to be slightly overvalued. But as a rule of thumb, an average ratio below 100% tells you that your agent is consistently selling homes for less than the listed price.",
    "After saving up for a long time, I recently bought a home, which caught some of my friends off\u2026",
    "You don\u2019t want to hire an agent just because they suggest the highest list price. Your agent\u2019s job is to assess your home\u2019s worth ",
    "accurately",
    " using recent market data and apples-to-apples comparisons of similar homes recently sold. They should be able to explain their thought process and make a convincing case for their price point, using concrete examples. You\u2019ll also want an agent that knows your local area inside and out.",
    "When hired, your agent will place your home on a home listing database called the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), schedule open houses,",
    " or otherwise arrange for buyers to visit your property. But that\u2019s just the bare minimum. Your prospective agent should be able to offer a blend of both offline and online marketing. They should be able to produce high-quality images of your house, both video and photos; promote your property on social media accounts (Facebook, Y",
    "ouT",
    "ube, Twitter); and print high-quality glossy brochures (especially for an open house). A good agent will have good ideas for staging and able to suggest a professional stager if you agree that it\u2019s needed.",
    "An interview will help you determine whether your realtor is the right fit for you. You want an agent that is patient, objective, and resourceful. If you feel like they are pressuring you to hire them, walk away. ",
    "What are other good questions you might ask a prospective agent? Let us know in the comments. "

If you\u2019re lucky, you work at a place where nobody cares what you\u2019re wearing. But if not, keep a blazer or a cute top near your desk, and pop it on before a meeting.",

    "total, su registro hist\u00f3rico m\u00e1s bajo debido sobre todo a las afectaciones que esta industria tuvo por una baja en la demanda pero tambi\u00e9n por las disrupciones en las cadenas de suministro globales.",

    "\r\n",
    "Durante 2020 la demanda neta (excluye renovaciones y prearrendamientos) en el mercado industrial, se increment\u00f3 6.4% y esperamos que este 2021 vuelva a crecer 7.8% impulsada principalmente por los sectores log\u00edstico y manufactura. ",
    "Los motores de esta demanda durante 2020 se encontraron focalizados en Monterrey,",
    " Guadalajara y la Zona Metropolitana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (ZMCM) que concentraron casi el 50% de la demanda neta del mercado nacional.",
    "\r\n",
    "El reto en algunos mercados de contar con tierra con infraestructura para desarrollar, la vacancia o disponibilidad ha ido consistentemente a la baja en los mercados del norte y de la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (ZMCM). ",
    "Ejemplo de ello son Ju\u00e1rez, Reynosa y Tijuana que promedian tasas de vacancia/disponibilidad entre 1.3 y 2.2%;",
    " en tanto que los proyectos en construcci\u00f3n est\u00e1n en Monterrey, Saltillo y ZMCM que representan 45% del total en construcci\u00f3n.",
    "\r\n",
    "En casi todos los mercados de M\u00e9xico continuamos registrando precios estables ",
    "con presiones al alza en los mercados donde la tierra escasea: Tijuana (+13%) y Reynosa (12%), principalmente.",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Sector clave ",
    "\r\n",
    "Otro factor importante en la demanda en el mediano plazo ser\u00e1 la reactivaci\u00f3n del sector automotriz, ",
    "que cuenta con 13% de nuestro monitoreo de usuarios que estar\u00e1n buscando espacios en los siguientes 8 a 10 meses. ",
    "\r\n",
    "Para la primera parte de 2021, la log\u00edstica y la manufactura (excluyendo automotriz y electr\u00f3nica) representan el 60% de los requerimientos de espacio. ",
    "Se espera que los alquileres log\u00edsticos aumenten en todos los mercados en 2021.",
    "\r\n",
    "Las principales existencias log\u00edsticas ocupadas por el almacenamiento impulsado por la pandemia ser\u00e1n devueltas al mercado, limitando las perspectivas de crecimiento del alquiler. Se prev\u00e9 que los alquileres se estabilicen ",
    "debido al aumento de la demanda de reubicaci\u00f3n forzada resultante de la reurbanizaci\u00f3n y revitalizaci\u00f3n de los edificios industriales m\u00e1s antiguos.",
    "\r\n",
    "En 2021 se ver\u00e1 un mayor crecimiento del alquiler, pero la recuperaci\u00f3n se retrasar\u00e1 por un segundo cierre en el tercer trimestre de 2020 y un n\u00famero creciente de espacio de subsidios liberado por los ocupantes de Third Party Logistics (3PL",
    "). Los propietarios institucionales comenzaron a reducir los incentivos del H2 2020 a medida que se conten\u00eda la pandemia.",
    " Es probable que el r\u00e1pido aumento de los precios de la tierra y los costos de construcci\u00f3n se traduzcan en alquileres m\u00e1s altos en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os.",
    "\r\n",
    "Finalmente, CBRE apunta a que la fortaleza del mercado industrial continuar\u00e1 generando inter\u00e9s por parte de los inversionistas institucionales que ven crecimiento en sus rendimientos. Los due\u00f1os actuales de portafolios de propiedades industriales estar\u00e1n incentivados a continuar cuidando la calidad de sus propiedades incluso invirtiendo ",
    "en nueva infraestructura como \u201ccuartos fr\u00edos\u201d y renovaci\u00f3n de propiedades antiguas localizadas en ubicaciones \u201cpremium\u201d.",
